RSI Strategy Overview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.

It is calculated using the average gains and losses over a given time period, typically 14 periods

The RSI oscillates between 0 and 100, with readings above 70 considered overbought and readings below 30 considered oversold

3.The RSI is calculated as follows

#Calculate the average gain and loss over N periods

#Smooth the gain and loss using an exponential moving average (EMA)

#Calculate the relative strength (RS) as the ratio of the smoothed gain to the smoothed loss

#Calculate the RSI using the formula: RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

#When the RSI crosses above 30 from below, it generates a buy signal

#When the RSI crosses below 70 from above, it generates a sell signal

#Divergences between the RSI and price can also signal potential reversals.

$ Strategy Implementation To implement this strategy in Pine Script, you would

Calculate the RSI using the ta.rsi() function Define overbought and oversold levels (e.g. 70 and 30) Use ta.crossover() and ta.crossunder() to detect when the RSI crosses the overbought/oversold levels Plot the RSI and overbought/oversold levels using plot() Plot buy/sell signals using plotshape() when the RSI crosses the levels Be sure to include clear descriptions of the strategy and RSI calculation in your GitHub README file. Use proper risk management, as the strength of the trend can override overbought/oversold signals.
